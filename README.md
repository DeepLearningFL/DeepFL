# DeepFL
DeepFL is a deep-learning-based fault localization technique. The dataset is collected from real faults project [Defects4j](https://github.com/rjust/defects4j), including different dimensions of features, e.g., spectrum-based, mutation-based,complexity-based and textual-similarity-based features. The dataset can be downloaded from a online [Cloud Drive] (https://mega.nz/#F!ffxXBISD!UQjggpnjw8oWrjSc0D7PdA)
DeepFL implements two multi-layer perceptron variants and two recurrent neural networks variants by [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
